        <p>When asked Question 1 Mr.O said, "I thought when I was doing my Computer Science course the skills learned<br>
            would be used to provide a learning workflow. Mr.O also said he was hoping to become a game developer".</p>
        <p>When asked Question 2 Mr.O responded with, "I apply my computer skills to my ability to learn, this provides<br>
            me more workflow. I sometimes feels like I lacks the skills I need. I feels that the computer helps him distribute<rb>
            workflow to others".</p>
        <p>When asked Question 4 Mr.O said, " I think that computer science is practical mathematics. I also think that computer<br>
             computer science is the optimal way for someone to learn about the world".</p>

            making the game jeopardy to learn about if statements. I started with math and cs courses in university. I didn't <br>
            enjoy it at the time. I never had a "job" in computer science but I was interested. overall I wanted something to do".</p>
        <p>When asked Question 6 Mr.O responded with, "My teachers throughout school and Daniel Shiffman influenced my opinions of<br>
            computer science".</p>
        <p>When asked Question 8 Mr.O said, "Yes and No. I naturally do due as hmy duty as a teacher, but I think that I just provide<br>
            a work flow. I provide it less like a science and more as a thing to do."</p>
